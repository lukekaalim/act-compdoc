Writing this post seems like starting over, which of course
is something that I find myself continually doing, but more
realistically this is more of a re-organizing.

Previously, I had placed a few random "act-related" packages
in the main `@lukekaalim/act` repo - but since the refactor
that properly established a nice Reconciler/Renderer/Core
workflow, I've been wanting to strip back that repository
to just contain packages related to the main systems.

"Act-Plus" was originally just a meant to include component
documentation (component-doc was the first packages)
but quickly expanded as I realized I wanted to bring back
my animations, and then markdown renderer, and then routing.
